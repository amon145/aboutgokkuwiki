		<h3><em>Conception</em></h3>
		<ul>
		
			<li>Goku, and Dragon Ball in general, evolved from one of Akira Toriyama's earlier one-shot series called Dragon Boy.</li>
			<li>In this story, the protagonist who looks a lot like Goku has a pair of wings.</li>
			<li>Toriyama created Dragon Ball, he was inspired by Journey to the West.[8] To be creative with the idea, Toriyama designed Goku as a human boy with a monkey's tail, rather than a complete simian, because the tail would give him a distinguishing feature.</li>
			<li>Wanting Dragon Ball to have a Chinese appearance, Toriyama used the color of the robes worn by Buddhist monks for Goku's dogi.</li>
